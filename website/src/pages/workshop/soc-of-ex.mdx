## Getting started

We can write and run code interactively in this worksheet.

Feel free to edit any of the code you see - you can always refresh the page to get the original worksheet back.

* [workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1plRW7-JWIeHnKLvuVu9hN1u0I0ymfK4LFOLD4AGSu38/edit?usp=sharing)
* [your samples](https://github.com/heavy-lifting/soc-ex/tree/main)

This is how we write a basic pattern in Strudel.
* `sound` is a function that tells strudel we want to play a sound
* Inside the speech marks we write the names of the sounds we want to play (more on this later)


<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh")`} dirt />



* You play the sound by pressing the play button or hitting `ctrl` and `enter`
* You can stop the sound by hitting `ctrl` and `.`
* The sounds have to load so you might not hear them first time round



What happens if we put more sounds in the pattern?
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh hh bd oh sd")`} dirt />

Even more?
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh hh bd oh sd hh sn oh bd")`} dirt />

The pattern becomes much faster and denser - this is because Strudel has a consistent 'cycle' of time running in the background.
Any sounds in the pattern will run within that cycle, and Strudel will try to space them evenly in time.
(Unless we tell it not to... we'll learn how to do that later).

This means that the pulse of the pattern is dictated by the number of elements

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh bd sd")`} dirt />

vs.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh bd hh cp hh bd hh")`} dirt />

Later on when we learn how to play multiple patterns at once this gives us some opportunities to play with rhythm.

Now try writing your own pattern with some of these other sounds:

`insect wind jazz metal east crow casio space numbers`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={``} dirt />

## Mininotation

The green writing inside the speech marks has its own set of rules. We call this the 'mininotation' and it's the core of how Strudel generates patterns.

We can speed things up with `*`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*4")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*32")`} dirt />

Or slow them down with `/` - the snare only sounds every other cycle:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd/2") `} dirt />

We can choose different sounds from a set using `:`. The computer starts counting at `0`, so `casio:0` is the same as `casio`.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio casio casio")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 casio casio:5")`} dirt />

We can add a rest using `~`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 ~ casio:5")`} dirt />

We can create more variation with sub-sequences.
We do this by breaking our steps down into mini patterns using `[]`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd bd hh")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp] [hh oh]")`} dirt />

Let's have a look at how that looks visually:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp] [hh oh]")`} dirt punchcard />

You can nest sequences within sequences for dense patterns

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("[[bd [bd bd bd bd]] bd sd] [bd cp]")`} dirt punchcard />

We can also schedule events across multiple cycles using `<>`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5")`} dirt />

Let's add some easy randomness using `?`. 
Putting `?` after a sound means there is a 50% probability that the sound will play.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*8?")`} dirt />

## Chaining functions (and making it sound more interesting)

Let's learn about chaining functions together. This is how we start to make more complex patterns.

There's another way of selecting samples, using a function called `n` - this gives us a bit more flexibility in writing patterns.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 casio casio:5")`} dirt />

We connect the functions together using `.`. The `n` function also uses the mininotation to create a pattern of numbers

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt />

This saves us a bit of typing, and makes things easier to edit as we go.

(This next part is a bit confusing, don't worry too much if it doesn't make sense right now)

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt />

We can chain functions together in any order, however, because Strudel always takes the rhythm from the first pattern, we need to be careful how we do this:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio").n("0 1 0 5")`} dirt />

So far we've been looking at choosing different sounds from the folder with `n`. 
We can also choose different pitches with `note`.

This works in the same way as `n`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt />

Or we can combine the two:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1 0 5").sound("casio").n("<0 2>")`} dirt />

And we can make use of all the mininotation we learned above in the `note` or `n` pattern

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1*3 <0 [~ 7]> 5").sound("casio <space jazz>")`} dirt />

Strudel does its best to map the two patterns together, based on when each event in the pattern starts.


## Effects
Ok, let's try adding some effects.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5")`} dirt />

The `vowel` effect is a kind of filter.

Notice again that we chain functions together using `.`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").vowel("a")`} dirt />

We can use mini-notation to create a pattern in the effect:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").vowel("<a e>")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").vowel("a e i")`} dirt />

Most effects take a pattern of numbers. `pan` moves the signal left and right:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").pan("0 1")`} dirt />

`room` adds reverb:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").room("<0 0 1 2>")`} dirt />

We can chain effects together:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").room("<0 0 1 2>").pan("0 1").vowel("<a o p>")`} dirt />

## Stacking patterns
We can play multiple patterns at the same time if we start each new line with `$:`

Let's start with our drum pattern:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd <~ sd>")`} dirt />

And our synth line from above:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").room("<0 0 1 2>").pan("0 1").vowel("<a o p>")`} dirt />

And play them both at the same time:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("bd hh*2 bd <~ sd>")
$: sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5").room("<0 0 1 2>").pan("0 1").vowel("<a o p>")`} dirt />

If we separate out the lines we can add comments in using `//` - the computer will ignore comments.
This can help us keep track of what's going on.
If our code is getting a bit messy we can break it out onto separate lines within the stack too.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//drums:
$: sound("bd hh*2 bd <~ sd>")
//synth:
$: sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5")
  .room("<0 0 1 2>")
  .pan("0 1")
  .vowel("<a o p>")`} dirt />

## Your samples

We need to load your samples in from the internet using the `samples` function.

Then we can call them in the same way as usual.

The samples are in four banks:
* `per` (23 sounds) - these are percussive samples
* `tone` (28 sounds) - these are tonal samples
* `text` (33 sounds) - these are textural samples
* `long` (19 sounds) - these are longer samples (we handle these slightly differently - we'll come to that later)

Remember if you re-load the worksheet you may have to run this chunk again to load the samples back in.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`samples('github:heavy-lifting/soc-ex')

n("1 5 8 23").sound("tone")`} dirt />

Try writing some patterns using the other sound banks

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//per
`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//text
`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//long
`} dirt />


## Pattern transformation
Ok, so things are starting to sound a bit better. Let's explore some ways of creating more complex patterns.

Let's start with a simple drum beat:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per")`} dirt />

We can slow that down with `slow()`:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").slow(2)`} dirt />

Or speed it up with `fast()`:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").fast(2)`} dirt />

You can change the number in brackets after `fast` or `slow` to change how much we speed up or slow down by.
You can even pattern that number using the mininotation!

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").slow("1 2")`} dirt />

It might seem like something a bit weird is happening here - basically Strudel is switching between two versions of the pattern, the normal version and the slow version.
It can be a bit hard to get your head round exactly what's happening sometimes, but as long as you're happy with the sound I don't think it matters too much.

We can incorporate fast and slow into our stack:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//drums:
$: n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").fast("1 1 2")
//synth:
$: n("0 <[1 2] 3> ~ 4")
  .sound("tone")
  .room("<0 0 1 2>")
  .pan("0 1")
  .vowel("<a o p>")
  .slow("1 1 2 4")`} dirt />

Let's think about some other kinds of patterns - `rev()` lets us play a pattern backwards:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[1 2] 3> ~ 4").sound("tone")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[1 2] 3> ~ 4").sound("tone").rev()`} dirt />

Or we can use `every()` to apply a transformation every so many cycles:

Notice here we are combining the functions in a different way. The `every()` function takes two arguments, which are separated by a comma. The first one is the number of cycles to trigger the transformation, the second one is the transformation.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[1 2] 3> ~ 4").sound("tone").every(4, rev())`} dirt />

We can pass any function as the second argument to the `every()` function:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[6 7] 8> ~ 10").sound("tone").every(4, slow(2))`} dirt />

Or we can do something similar with `sometimes` which will apply a transformation with 50% likelihood:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").sometimes(rev)`} dirt />

This can sound quite confusing as it's randomly jumping between the forwards and backwards versions of the pattern. We can use `someCycles()` instead to choose once per cycle.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").someCycles(rev)`} dirt />

`Iter` starts the pattern at a different point each cycle, giving us a rotational pattern:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("1 2 3 4").sound("numbers").iter(4).slow(2)`} dirt punchcard />

This can lead to some nice variation across time:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//drums:
$: n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").every(3, rev)
//synth:
$: n("0 <[6 7] 8> ~ 10")
.sound("tone")
.room("<0 0 1 2>")
.pan("0 1")
.vowel("<a o p>")
.iter(4)`} dirt />

Finally, we can apply a transformation in one speaker only using `jux`:
(although for some reason this isn't working as expected...)

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 <7 9> [~ 2]").sound("per").jux(rev)`} dirt />

### Long samples

If we play a long sample it will be triggered every cycle and so we will end up with an overlapping effect.
This can sound good, but it's not always what we're looking for.
Here are a few functions to help you work with longer sounds.

`loopAt` will loop the sample at a set number of cycles

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("long").loopAt("1")`} dirt />

We can of course pattern that too:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("3 4 5 6").sound("long").loopAt("<1 2>")`} dirt />

`slice` cuts the sample into equal slices and then lets us pattern how they are played back:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("3").sound("long").slice(8, "5 3 1 [~ 2*2]").iter(4)`} dirt />

## Bonus content:

### Polyrhythm/polymeter
Health warning: I may have got these mixed up...

We can use `stack` or `[,]` to create polyrhythmic structures - in this case patterns of three over four

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: n("10 11 14 17").sound("per")
$: n("12 18 22").sound("tone")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("[per per per, text text]")`} dirt punchcard />

We can use `{,}` to create polymetrical structures - the elements of the pattern _after_ the comma will follow the same pulse as those _before_ the comma
This can give us a sense of rotation over time.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("{per per:6 [~ per:14] per:27, text:17 ~ ~ ~ tone:29}")`} dirt />

### Euclidian rhythm

We can use brackets after the name of a sound to define a Euclidian rhythm - Strudel will try to space the first number of events over the second number of steps:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("per:18(3,8)")`} dirt />

We can rotate the pattern so it starts on a different step by using a third argument:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("tone:17(3,8,<0 2>)")`} dirt />

Try experimenting with different values.
