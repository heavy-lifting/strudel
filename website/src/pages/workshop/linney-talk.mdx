# Introduction to live coding
## Linney creative forum
## Getting started

We can write and run code interactively in this worksheet.

Feel free to edit any of the code you see - you can always refresh the page to get the original worksheet back.

This is how we write a basic pattern in Strudel.
* `sound` is a function that tells strudel we want to play a sound
* Inside the speech marks we write the names of the sounds we want to play
* To see the complete list of sounds click 'go to REPL' then 'sounds' then 'samples'
* You play the sound by pressing the play button or hitting `ctrl` and `enter`
* You can stop the sound by hitting `ctrl` and `.`
* The sounds have to load from the internet so you might not hear them first time round

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh")`} dirt punchcard/>

The more sounds we put in the pattern the denser it becomes.
This is because Strudel handles time in a non-linear way
Imagine a consistent 'cycle' of time running in the background.
Any sounds in the pattern will run within that cycle, and Strudel will try to space them evenly in time.
(Unless we tell it not to... we'll learn how to do that later).
This means the pulse is dictated by the number of elements in the pattern. 
This gives us some nice opportunities to play with rhythms:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("bd hh sd oh")
$: sound("casio:1 casio:2 casio:3")`} dirt punchcard/>

Now try writing your own pattern with some of these other sounds:

`insect wind jazz metal east crow casio space numbers`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={``} dirt punchcard/>

## Mininotation

The green writing inside the speech marks has its own set of rules. We call this the 'mininotation' and it's the core of how Strudel generates patterns.

We can speed things up with `*`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*32 oh")`} dirt punchcard/>

Or slow them down with `/` - the clap only sounds every other cycle:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*8 cp/2") `} dirt punchcard/>

We can choose different sounds from a set using `:`. The computer starts counting at `0`, so `casio:0` is the same as `casio`.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 casio casio:5")`} dirt punchcard/>

We can add a rest using `~`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 ~ casio:5")`} dirt punchcard/>

We can create more variation with sub-sequences.
We do this by breaking our steps down into mini patterns using `[]`
You can nest these together to create dense patterns.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp] [hh [~ hh oh]]")`} dirt punchcard/>

We can also schedule events across multiple cycles using `<>`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5")`} dirt punchcard/>

Let's add some easy randomness using `?`. 
Putting `?` after a sound means there is a 50% probability that the sound will play.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*8?")`} dirt punchcard/>

We can use brackets after the name of a sound to define a Euclidian rhythm - Strudel will try to space the first number of events over the second number of steps:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("jazz(3,8)")`} dirt punchcard/>

We can rotate the pattern so it starts on a different step by using a third argument:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("jazz(3,8)")
$: sound("cp(3,8,<0 2>)")`} dirt punchcard/>

Try experimenting with different values.


## Chaining functions (and making it sound more interesting)

So far so good, but we want to start making things sound a bit more interesting. 
We do that by chaining together functions using `.`
We can then use those functions to transform either our patterns or the sounds themselves.
We can even create patterns of parametes for our functions using the mininotation we learned above.

We can also choose different pitches with `note`.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt punchcard/>

We can put the functions together in any order, but notice what it does to the sound -
this is due to how Strudel maps one pattern to the other - it always takes the structure from the first pattern in the sequence
So in this case we only hear one note, because the first pattern just has one element - `casio`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio").note("0 1 0 5")`} dirt punchcard/>

And we can make use of all the mininotation we learned above in the `note` pattern
Strudel does its best to map the two patterns together, based on when each event in the pattern starts.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1*3 <0 [~ 7]> 5").sound("casio <space jazz>")`} dirt punchcard/>

## Pattern transformation
Ok, so things are starting to sound a bit better. Let's explore some ways of creating more complex patterns.

Let's start with a simple drum beat:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator")`} dirt punchcard/>

We can slow that down with `slow()`:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").slow(2)`} dirt punchcard/>

Or speed it up with `fast()`:
<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").fast(2)`} dirt punchcard/>

You can change the number in brackets after `fast` or `slow` to change how much we speed up or slow down by.
You can even pattern that number using the mininotation!

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").slow("1 2")`} dirt punchcard/>

It might seem like something a bit weird is happening here - basically Strudel is switching between two versions of the pattern, the normal version and the slow version.
It can be a bit hard to get your head round exactly what's happening sometimes, but as long as you're happy with the sound I don't think it matters too much.

Let's think about some other kinds of patterns - `rev()` lets us play a pattern backwards:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator")
$: sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").rev()`} dirt punchcard/>

Or we can use `every()` to apply a transformation every so many cycles. 
Notice here we are combining the functions in a different way. The `every()` function takes two arguments, which are separated by a comma. The first one is the number of cycles to trigger the transformation, the second one is the transformation.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").every(4, rev())`} dirt punchcard/>

We can pass any function as the second argument to the `every()` function:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").every(4, fast(2))`} dirt punchcard/>

Or we can do something similar with `sometimes` which will apply a transformation with 50% likelihood:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").sometimes(rev)`} dirt punchcard/>

This can sound quite confusing as it's randomly jumping between the forwards and backwards versions of the pattern. We can use `someCycles()` instead to choose once per cycle.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").someCycles(rev)`} dirt punchcard/>

`Iter` starts the pattern at a different point each cycle, giving us a rotational pattern:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("1 2 3 4").sound("numbers").iter(4).slow(2)`} dirt punchcard punchcard/>

This can lead to some nice variation across time:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//drums:
$:sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]")sound("bd hh*2 bd [~ cp]").bank("EmuDrumulator").every(3, rev)
//synth:
$: n("0 <[6 7] 8> ~ 10")
.sound("casio")
.vowel("<a o p>")
.iter(4)`} dirt punchcard/>

Finally, we can apply a transformation in one speaker only using `jux`:
(although for some reason this sometimes doesn't work as expected...)

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh*2 <cp oh> [~ sd]").bank("EmuDrumulator").jux(rev)`} dirt punchcard/>

## Bonus content:

### Polyrhythm/polymeter
Health warning: I always get these mixed up...

Earlier we saw that we can create polyrhythmic structures by combining patterns of different lengths.
Strudel gives us a handy shortcut for this if we use `[,]`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("[bd rs <cp oh> [~ sd], hh hh hh*2]").bank("EmuDrumulator")`} dirt punchcard/>

I really enjoy this kind of falling-over-itself rhyhtm, but if it's a bit much we can anchor it with a strong pulse to back it up.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("[bd rs <cp oh> [~ sd], hh hh hh*2]").bank("EmuDrumulator")
$: sound("bd*4").bank("EmuDrumulator").shape(0.4)`} dirt punchcard punchcard/>

We can use `{,}` to create polymetrical structures - the elements of the pattern _after_ the comma will follow the same pulse as those _before_ the comma
This can give us a sense of rotation over time.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("{bd sd:6 [~ cp] hh, <metal:3 metal:5> ~ ~ ~ metal:6}")`} dirt punchcard/>
